Version 2.1.0 (January 7th 2012)
--------------------------------

 * Wrapped in self executing function to be more easily used with loaders like `require.js` or `curl.js` (issue #15)
 * Allow event to be cancelled by returning `false` from `onleavestate` handler (issue #13) - WARNING: this breaks backward compatibility for async transitions (you now need to return `StateMachine.ASYNC` instead of `false`)
 * Added explicit return values for event methods (issue #12)
 * Added support for wildcard events that can be fired 'from' any state (issue #11)
 * Added support for no-op events that transition 'to' the same state  (issue #5)
 * extended custom error callback to handle any exceptions caused by caller provided callbacks
 * added custom error callback to override exception when an illegal state transition is attempted (thanks to cboone)
 * fixed typos (thanks to cboone)
 * fixed issue #4 - ensure before/after event hooks are called even if the event doesn't result in a state change 

Version 2.0.0 (August 19th 2011)
--------------------------------

 * adding support for asynchronous state transitions (see README) - with lots of qunit tests (see test/async.js).
 * consistent arguments for ALL callbacks, first 3 args are ALWAYS event name, from state and to state, followed by whatever arguments the user passed to the original event method.
 * added a generic `onchangestate(event,from,to)` callback to detect all state changes with a single function.
 * allow callbacks to be declared at creation time (instead of having to attach them afterwards)
 * renamed 'hooks' => 'callbacks'
