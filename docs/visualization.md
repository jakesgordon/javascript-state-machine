# Visualization

It can be very helpful to visualize your state machine as a directed graph. This is possible
with the open source [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) library if we convert from our
state machine configuration to the `.dot` language expected by GraphViz using the
`visualize` method.

A `main.js` file defining the following FSM:

```javascript
  var visualize = require('javascript-state-machine/lib/visualize');

  var fsm = new StateMachine({
    init: 'open',
    transitions: [
      { name: 'close', from: 'open',   to: 'closed' },
      { name: 'open',  from: 'closed', to: 'open'   }
    ]
  });

  console.log(visualize(fsm));
```

Generates the following .dot syntax:

```dot
  digraph "fsm" {
    "closed";
    "open";
    "closed" -> "open" [ label=" open " ];
    "open" -> "closed" [ label=" close " ];
  }
```

Which GraphViz displays as:

```bash
node main.js | dot -Tpng -o graph.png && open graph.png
```

## Enhanced Visualization

You can customize the generated `.dot` output - and hence the graphviz visualization - by attaching 
`dot` attributes to your transitions and (optionally) declaring an `orientation`:

```javascript
  var fsm = new StateMachine({
    init: 'closed',
    transitions: [
      { name: 'open',  from: 'closed', to: 'open',   dot: { color: 'blue', headport: 'n', tailport: 'n' } },
      { name: 'close', from: 'open',   to: 'closed', dot: { color: 'red',  headport: 's', tailport: 's' } }
    ]
  });
  console.log(visualize(fsm, { name: 'door', orientation: 'horizontal' }));
```

Generates the following (enhanced) `.dot` syntax:

```dot
  digraph "door" {
    rankdir=LR;
    "closed";
    "open";
    "closed" -> "open" [ color="blue" ; headport="n" ; label=" open " ; tailport="n" ];
    "open" -> "closed" [ color="red" ; headport="s" ; label=" close " ; tailport="s" ];
  }
```

Which GraphViz displays as:

![door](../examples/horizontal_door.png)

## Visualizing State Machine Factories

You can use the same `visualize` method to generate `.dot` output for a state machine factory:

```javascript
  var Matter = StateMachine.factory({
    init: 'solid',
    transitions: [
      { name: 'melt',     from: 'solid',  to: 'liquid', dot: { headport: 'nw' } },
      { name: 'freeze',   from: 'liquid', to: 'solid',  dot: { headport: 'se' } },
      { name: 'vaporize', from: 'liquid', to: 'gas',    dot: { headport: 'nw' } },
      { name: 'condense', from: 'gas',    to: 'liquid', dot: { headport: 'se' } }
    ]
  });

  console.log(visualize(Matter, { name: 'matter', orientation: 'horizontal' }));
```

Generates the following .dot syntax:

```dot
  digraph "matter" {
    rankdir=LR;
    "solid";
    "liquid";
    "gas";
    "solid" -> "liquid" [ headport="nw" ; label=" melt " ];
    "liquid" -> "solid" [ headport="se" ; label=" freeze " ];
    "liquid" -> "gas" [ headport="nw" ; label=" vaporize " ];
    "gas" -> "liquid" [ headport="se" ; label=" condense " ];
  }
```

Which GraphViz displays as:

![matter](../examples/matter.png)

## Other Examples

```javascript
  var Wizard = StateMachine.factory({
    init: 'A',
    transitions: [
      { name: 'step',  from: 'A',               to: 'B', dot: { headport: 'w',  tailport: 'ne' } },
      { name: 'step',  from: 'B',               to: 'C', dot: { headport: 'w',  tailport: 'e' } },
      { name: 'step',  from: 'C',               to: 'D', dot: { headport: 'w',  tailport: 'e' } },
      { name: 'reset', from: [ 'B', 'C', 'D' ], to: 'A', dot: { headport: 'se', tailport: 's' } }
    ]
  });

  console.log(visualize(Wizard, { orientation: 'horizontal' }));
```

Generates:

```dot
  digraph "wizard" {
    rankdir=LR;
    "A";
    "B";
    "C";
    "D";
    "A" -> "B" [ headport="w" ; label=" step " ; tailport="ne" ];
    "B" -> "C" [ headport="w" ; label=" step " ; tailport="e" ];
    "C" -> "D" [ headport="w" ; label=" step " ; tailport="e" ];
    "B" -> "A" [ headport="se" ; label=" reset " ; tailport="s" ];
    "C" -> "A" [ headport="se" ; label=" reset " ; tailport="s" ];
    "D" -> "A" [ headport="se" ; label=" reset " ; tailport="s" ];
  }
```

    transitions: [

  })

  console.log(visualize(ATM));
